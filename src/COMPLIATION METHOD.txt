Here I introduce how to compile Multiwfn (64bit version) in Linux by Intel Fortran compiler, the compiler version I am using is 15.0.0, my system is CentOS 7.2 (64bit). I assume that you have logged on your system as root.
PS: Don't try to use gfortran to compile Multiwfn, you must fail, because gfortran has lunatic requirement on the format of Fortran code, and the code relies on many features of ifort as well as intel MKL library.

1 Uncompress the source code package to your favorite path, I assume the path is /sob/Multiwfn. In the package you can find following files:
a lot of .f90 files (except dislin_d.f90) // Source code of Multiwfn
Lebedev-Laikov.F // A file containing the routines for generating Lebedev integration points
DFTxclib.F // A file containing the routines for calculating DFT exchange-correlation functionals
dislin_d-11.0.a and dislin_d.f90 // Static library and module file of Dislin graphical library

2 Ensure that you have installed developer edition of motif (e.g. motif-devel-2.3.4-1.x86_64_0), because libXm.a in this package is necessary in compilation of Multiwfn. If you have not installed it, you can search the package from the CD of your Linux distribution or download it from http://motif.ics.com/motif/downloads. If you are using CentOS/RHEL system, you can also directly run "yum install motif-devel" to install it.

Also ensure that you have installed mesa-libGL-devel and mesa-libGLU-devel packages, under CentOS/RHEL you can use "yum install libGL-devel libGLU-devel" to install them.

3 Go to /sob/Multiwfn folder, then run "make -j"

If no any exception occurs, you will find executable file "Multiwfn" in current folder. Other file needed for running Multiwfn (settings.ini) is provided in binary package of Multiwfn. If this is the first time you use Linux version of Multiwfn, don't forget to read Section 2.1.2 of the manual to know how to prepare the running environment.


============ Compile Multiwfn without GUI and plotting functionalities  ============

If you encounter difficulties when compiling Multiwfn due to missing or incompatibility of some graphical library files, and in the meantime you don't need visualization functions of Multiwfn, you can compile Multiwfn without GUI supported, all functions irrelevant to GUI and map plotting will still work normally. The compilation steps are:

1 ./noGUI.sh
2 cd noGUI
3 make
