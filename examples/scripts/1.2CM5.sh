# A script to calculate 1.2*CM5 charge based on Gaussian 16 and Multiwfn
# Written by Tian Lu (sobereva@sina.com), 2021-Jan-28
# If this script is employed in your work, please cite Multiwfn properly
#
# Usage: 1.2CM5.sh [geometry file] [net charge] [spin multiplicity]
# "geometry file" should be any format that Multiwfn can load, e.g. xyz/mol/mol2/pdb/fch/molden/wfn/wfx/mwfn/gjf...
# "net charge" is default to 0 if not given
# "spin multiplicity" is default to 1 if not given
#
# Example:
# Calculating neutral singlet molecule: 1.2CM5.sh H2O.xyz
# Calculating anionic singlet molecule: 1.2CM5.sh ani.pdb -1 1
#
# Note:
# This script invokes g16, if you are using other version of Gaussian, you should modify "Gaussian" variable at line 22
# If this script does not run successfully, please check if Gaussian and Multiwfn have been properly installed, and check content of the Gaussian output file "gau.out" in current folder
# Optimization and calculation of CM5 charges will be conducted in vaccum under B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level. The finally produced 1.2*CM5 charges are very suitable for OPLS-AA forcefield
